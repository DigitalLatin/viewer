#The TEI Critical Apparatus Module and Digital Critical Editions, or Why Your Digital Edition Should Have a Data Model

The myriad possibilities offered by digital methods have a way of crowding out the requirements when it comes to thinking about digital critical editions, to the point where the edition itself tends to disappear. The requirements of a critical edition are fairly well­-understood, even though the details vary. For Classical Latin texts in the anglo-­american tradition, a critical edition is a text that represents the editor’s attempt to reconstruct the author’s text using the sources and scholarship available. That text is supported by an apparatus consisting of notes anchored to the text which indicate where source texts, previous editions, and other conjectures vary from or support what the editor has printed, or where the editor makes conjectures that they do not want to print in the text. The apparatus uses a highly-­abbreviated syntax whose abbreviations are either defined in the edition’s introduction or conform to longstanding practice. The introduction also discusses things like the history and nature of the text’s transmission.
A digital edition might do these basic things, but also many more. It might present images and transcriptions of the source manuscripts. It might link to prior editions. It might permit automated differencing between any of these. It might contain the editor’s collation of manuscripts. It might permit user annotation and commentary. It might expand the apparatus, allowing users to follow the full trail of scholarship around any aspect of textual variation. It might permit users to experiment with the editor’s decisions about the text and to agree or disagree with them, making their own edition.
A printed critical edition conceals a vast amount of work under its relatively straightforward presentation of the text. The real promises of the digital edition are threefold: that the threads of that vast work might be made visible, and even manipulable, to readers, that the work itself might be distributed and therefore accomplished faster and at a lower cost to contributors, and that the end result might be reusable and re-purposable by other scholars. Much of the groundwork for digital editions has been done. There exist tools for presenting and annotating digitized manuscripts. Many out-­of-­copyright editions have been scanned and OCR’ed by entities like the Internet Archive. There are tools for collating multiple copies of texts automatically and for visualizing the differences between them.
In order for an interactive, online edition to be possible where the reader can choose to promote or demote readings and conjectures, that edition has both to know how those textual variances relate to one another and to be able to remember what choices have been made among the variants. It must be able to maintain its state (that is, remember what changes have been made to it) and encode a dependency graph to express the interdependencies between variances. It must, in addition, record links to various data sources and support linking to itself for annotation purposes.

## A Digression on formats and workflows
The difficulties involved in creating critical editions of most ancient works are hideous. Collating all of the various sources, deciding readings are relevant or not, considering all of the relevant scholarship, and finally deciding what to put in the text and what to put in the apparatus all take years of work. And as we've noted, in the digital environment, the choices of what to put in and what to leave out are even harder, because there are fewer constraints. In order to think clearly about what the affordances of an online critical edition should be, we will need to consider how we would want to represent all the aspects of that edition. Let us take it as a given that we can do in HTML visually anything that we could do in print, mutatis mutandis. There is nothing stopping us from creating an online analog to the printed edition that looks much the same as the original—the Loeb online editions do this rather well, for example. And, further, there is nothing preventing us from adding functionality to those HTML editions. There is a problem with this approach though: once you've produced an edition like this, it is, in many ways, as much of a dead end as a printed edition would be.  Because the semantics of HTML are no real improvement over those of print, where form signals function, we're left with a format that will only work properly within its setting.

The question, then, is whether we want to have a proper data model for our edition, and if so, how do we do it?

The latest version of HTML gives us some 79 elements that are usable in the body of an HTML document. Many of these have very specific semantics that make them unlikely to apply to our use case, while others are quite vague. Often, HTML's semantics are quite strange: `<ul>`, for example, represents a list whose order is not significant, while `<ol>` represents one whose order is significant. This is a bizarre distinction. All lists have order, by definition. Sometimes we number the items and sometimes we don't. The semantics of HTML's ordered and unordered lists are a kind of post facto rationalization of the original intent, to be able to display lists that have either numbers or bullets. HTML `<p>` is, similarly, not a paragraph in the sense of its normal definition: "a subdivision of a written composition that consists of one or more sentences, deals with one point or gives the words of one speaker, and begins on a new usually indented line". Rather, it marks any typographic block of text. You can't have an HTML list inside a paragraph, for example, even though this is a) a perfectly natural and normal phenomenon and b) lists need not be formatted as blocks of text themselves, even in HTML.

We can characterize these elements, at least in terms of their appearance, using the class attribute along with an accompanying CSS stylesheet. But there is no way to explicitly mark, e.g., a line of verse as such. If we want our HTML structure to constitute a data model, we will have to add some sort of formal definition—a set of guidelines—saying that, again, e.g., `<p class="line">` indicates a line of verse. Such a thing is an achievable goal, but a very large one, and we should note that most of the work has already been done in the form of the Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines.

TEI has what HTML lacks, a (mostly) very well-considered and mature set of semantic tags for encoding texts. It lacks what HTML has, however, in the form of rules for how to display and interact with its elements in a web browser.
